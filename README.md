To play the game: x64 --> Debug --> Mappy Project.exe

I built this game using the Maze Game as skeleton code and modified/added to it to create this 2D platformer cave diving game. I built the map in the Mappy Tile Editor using free png assets. I built the game using C++ and C in Visual Studio and the Allegro game library. It involves 2D sprite animations, collision detection, timers, 2D map creation and sound effects.
